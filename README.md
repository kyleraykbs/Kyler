# Project Description

Kylix is inspired by https://github.com/danth/stylix and is made as an active replacement. I had a few primary gripes with Stylix that inspired me to make Kylix.
1. You are forced to use unstable, without it your system can refuse to build.
2. The templates don't have paramiterized colors, this means themes on applications such as VsCode can look quite bad depending on the wallpaper.
3. Stylix cannot have a be scoped seperatly between home manager and nixos as it automatically propogates against both.

This is my attempt at doing better.
